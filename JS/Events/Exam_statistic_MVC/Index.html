<!-- The goal of this exercise is to write a code for the web application that helps with the exam statistics. 

The application should be form based.
  
html header should have output fields one below another showing the stats of passed and failled  students added to the bellow form in the main.
That is the number of students that have passed the exam, and both the number and the percentage of the 
students who has failed the exam.

The form itself should have three input fields and one button in the same row in the main part of the body. 
The first field should be the one where a user can select the name of the subject from the select list provided in the left part of the form. 
Second input field should be where the user can type in the name and surname of the student.Both name and surname should be provided and both should start with capitals. 
And the third input field is where the user can select a grade from the list provided. A grade should be valid numerical value from 1 to 10.
In the same row should be the add button. When the user clicks on the ADD button, 
the information about student and subject appears on the list titled with passed or failed depending on their score.
Synchronously, the exam statistics presented in the page header is updated with count of passed and the count and the percantage of the failed out of total number of entries
If provided input is not valid, appropriate error messages should be shown.
there should be a button in the bottom of the form that when clicked clears the form and the list of students and resets the statistics
Below that there should be two tables next to each other showcasing inputs entered in the form above
On the left side there should be the table of students who passed and on the right the table of the ones who failed shsowing the subject, student name and grade.

1.
write a constructor function with one argument that represents the name of the subject
add a method getSubjectName using classes that returns the subject name

2.
write a constructor function with two arguments that represent name and surname of a student but so both must start with a capital letter
add a method getStudentData using classes that returns the name and surname of the student

3.
write a constructor function with three arguments that represent a subject, a student, and a grade. 
add method getExamInfo using classes that returns the name of the subject and the name and surname of the student.
add a method hasPassed using classes that checks if the student has passed the exam. A student has passed the exam if their grade is greater than 5.
  
4.
write a function that collects all the data from the form
write a function that validates all collected data
write a function that updates the given list so it adds the new item at the end of the list
write a function that updates the part of the page with the statistics with the count and the percentages of passed and failed exams


5. 
Declare all necessary variables using  for managing passed and failed exams as well as their statistics.

Write all code that connects a user behaviour with application logic using jquery and ajax.
